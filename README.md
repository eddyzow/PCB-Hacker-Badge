# PCB-Hacker-Badge
A PCB business card for Hack Club's Undercity hackathon with special features! An upgrade to my original PCB business card, this card features an upgrade to Type 5 NFC (ST25DV) from Type 2, two LEDs instead of one, increased NFC field range, and additional updated information about myself. Created for Hack Club's Highway program.
